# The Design Pattern

### Definition:
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- Strategy lets the algorithms vary independently from clients that use it.


### Design Principle:
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
